# last_katas_ever

Based on the [free course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) by [ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/@ThePrimeagen), this repo collects my interpretations of the algorithms written in Rust.

Eventually, I will add a cli tool that will allow you to test yourself with katas.
